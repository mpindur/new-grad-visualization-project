# New Grad Opportunities Visualization Project

## Project Proposal

### Team Members: Victor Wang, Sarah Yun, Mark Pindur, Ojas Vashishtha

Our project proposal involves working with a dataset regarding employment from the CORGIS Dataset Project. The data in this library comes from the National Survey of Recent College Graduates, and it is accessible and downloadable straight from the hyperlinked website. This dataset includes fields such as the major and degree for graduated students, salaries, demographic information, employment status, reasons for unemployment and industry of employment.

The big problem that we plan to address is the difficulty students face when trying to navigate the confusing and intimidating new grad market. We want them to be able to visualize and compare the new grad opportunities and how the landscape of the pipeline from graduation to industry has changed over the years. As students, we understand the benefit of this information being available and accessible - and will seek to present it in such a way where similar job-seeking students can extract the most value out of our interactive visualizations - making it easy and intuitive to use. We could show how many graduates in a specific field either are unemployed, end up in a job similar to the field they studied in, end up in a job different from a field they studied in, and how long it took for them to find the job. One way we can show this comparison is to have two separate visualizations of different years side by side, allowing the user to pick the years they want to compare. Another visualization could provide more context behind the employment trends by comparing the different reasons for unemployment and how this is affected in correlation to the specific majors or field of study.

One potential other data source we could try to include is to compare the graduate employment rate for a certain year to the national average by pulling occupation or industry data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Additionally, we can find more information on where new entrants move for their first employment with more geographic data by state or metropolitan area. We could visualize this information with a map and visualize the migration pattern over time.

Overall, we feel there is real value in this project not only to present students, but for anyone seeking to understand the larger picture of new-grad opportunities and how they have changed over time.
